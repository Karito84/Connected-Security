# Connected-Security

Project from Codecademy. 

## Project Goals
In this project, I was supposed to use flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. 
I could choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine my own company.

You got to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but I was supposed to at least include:

1. A title and logo or splash image.
2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4. A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.


The project was supposed to be done with using flexbox styling for layout.
I was also required to use custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.
